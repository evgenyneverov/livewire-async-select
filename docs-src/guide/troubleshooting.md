# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions.

## Component Not Found

**Error**: `Component [async-select] not found`

**Solution**:
```bash
php artisan livewire:discover
composer dump-autoload
php artisan config:clear
```

## Styles Not Working

**Issue**: Component appears unstyled

**Solution**:
- Ensure Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap is loaded
- Check your CSS build process
- Verify Alpine.js is loaded

## Alpine.js Errors

**Error**: `Alpine is not defined` or `Cannot read property 'data' of undefined`

**Solution**:
Livewire 3 includes Alpine.js by default. Make sure you're using Livewire 3.3+:

```bash
composer require livewire/livewire:^3.3
```

## Component Not Interactive

**Issue**: Dropdown doesn't open, search doesn't work, options can't be selected

**Most Common Cause**: Missing `@stack('scripts')` in your layout

**Solution**:
Add `@stack('scripts')` to your layout file **after** `@livewireScripts`:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    @asyncSelectStyles
    @livewireStyles
</head>
<body>
    {{ $slot }}
    
    @livewireScripts
    @stack('scripts')  {{-- Required! --}}
</body>
</html>
```

The component uses this stack to register its Alpine.js component. Without it, the component will render but won't be interactive.

## AJAX Requests Failing

**Issue**: Endpoint not returning data

**Checklist**:
1. Verify endpoint URL is correct
2. Check response format matches required structure
3. Look at browser Network tab for errors
4. Ensure proper CORS headers if using separate API

## Wire:model Not Working

**Issue**: Selected value not updating in Livewire component

**Solution**:
- Use `wire:model.live` for instant updates
- Check property is public in component
- Verify property name matches

## Tests Failing

Run tests with:
```bash
composer test
```

Clear caches:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```
