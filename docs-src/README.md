## Quick Start

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require drpshtiwan/livewire-async-select
```

Use in your Blade views:

    placeholder="Select a user..."
/>

## Why Livewire Async Select?

Traditional select libraries like Select2 rely on jQuery and can be heavy and difficult to integrate with modern reactive frameworks. This package provides a native Livewire solution that:

- ✅ Works seamlessly with Livewire's reactive components
- ✅ Uses Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity
- ✅ Eliminates jQuery dependency
- ✅ Provides better integration with Laravel's ecosystem
- ✅ Offers cleaner, more maintainable code
